<p>
At age 10 in Edmonds, Washington, just outside of Seattle, Nick picked up the tenor saxophone and began to grow his interest and love for jazz music. His early influences were the giants of the 1950s and 60s, but since has found influence in almost every era of the 20th and 21st centuries. He quotes Coltrane as his biggest influence, developing an obsession in highschool.
