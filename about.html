  <p>Nickolas Reinert is a passionate multi-faceted musician and creative. Whether he displays that through his saxophone, computer, or composition, he has a voice stemming from his diverse influences throughout his life: his favorite jazz icons, more contemporary rap and rnb artists, and lesser known artists praised in the underground rap scene. Alongside his jazz studies with George Garzone, Godwin Louis, and Walter Smith III, among others, he is majoring in a degree in Electronic Producion and Design with a specialization in Sound Design for Video Games at the Berklee College of Music.
